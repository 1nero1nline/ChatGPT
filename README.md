# ProDGTL ChatGPT Integration

This repository is a starting point for using ChatGPT (powered by OpenAI Codex) alongside our Pro DGTL marketing operations. Store your automation scripts, prompt templates, and data processing notebooks here so that changes are tracked and easy to collaborate on.

## Directory structure

- **scripts/** – Python scripts that automate routine marketing tasks such as generating UTMs, pulling reports from advertising platforms, and preparing CSVs for our BI dashboards.
- **prompts/** – Templates and examples of prompts you can use with ChatGPT to generate ad copy, headlines, and other creative assets.
- **notebooks/** – Jupyter notebooks for experiments, analysis, and data exploration.
- **README.md** – You're reading it! Update this file with instructions and processes as our use of ChatGPT grows.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository or create new files directly on GitHub.
2. Use ChatGPT (Codex) to generate or refine code by describing your tasks in natural language.
3. Commit your scripts and templates back to this repo so everyone has access to the latest versions.

To connect ChatGPT to this repository via the ChatGPT GitHub connector, you'll need a personal access token (PAT) with `repo` scope. Generate a PAT from your GitHub account settings under Developer settings > Personal access tokens. Once generated, store the token securely in ChatGPT when prompted so it can read and write files on your behalf.

Feel free to add new directories or files as needed. Keep experimenting and document your findings for the team.
